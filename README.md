# ChatCibrx

ChatCibrx is an open-source, localhost-running chat application built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. It's designed to facilitate real-time communication through both group and private messaging. The application includes a unique feature where the first user registered as 'admin' is automatically granted administrative privileges. Moreover, it hosts a bot within group chats, which users can interact with by issuing the `/help` command to discover more about the available commands and features.

## Setting Up MongoDB Collections

Before starting the chat application, ensure the following collections are created in your MongoDB database:
- `users` - to store user registration and authentication information.
- `writeups` - for storing group chat messages or announcements.
- `messages_group` - to keep records of messages sent in group chats.
- `messages_private` - for storing private messages exchanged between users.

These collections will automatically be populated as you use the application.

After starting the application, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser to access the ChatCibrx. Register as a new user, or log in if you already have an account, and explore the features available. Remember, the first user to register as 'admin' will receive administrative privileges.
